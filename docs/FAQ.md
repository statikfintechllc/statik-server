**A:** The installer requires sudo for system dependencies. However, Statik-Server itself runs in user space.

### Q: What if the installation fails?
**A:** Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues. Most problems are related to missing dependencies or network connectivity.

### Q: Can I customize the installation directory?
**A:** Currently, Statik-Server installs to `~/.statik-server`. Custom installation directories will be supported in future versions.

## üíª VS Code Integration

### Q: What's the difference between local and web VS Code?
**A:** 
- **Local VS Code**: Native desktop application with full extension support
- **Web VS Code**: Browser-based, mobile-friendly, with web-compatible extensions

### Q: Can I use my existing VS Code extensions?
**A:** 
- **Local VS Code**: Yes, all extensions work
- **Web VS Code**: Only web-compatible extensions work

### Q: How do I sync settings between local and web VS Code?
**A:** Enable VS Code Settings Sync in both environments to keep settings, extensions, and keybindings synchronized.

### Q: Can I use VS Code remotely?
**A:** Yes! Use the mesh VPN to securely access your development environment from anywhere.

## ü§ñ GitHub Copilot

### Q: Do I need a GitHub Copilot subscription?
**A:** Yes, you need an active GitHub Copilot subscription to use AI features.

### Q: How do I set up GitHub Copilot?
**A:** Run `statik-cli config token` and follow the authentication prompts in VS Code.

### Q: Why isn't Copilot working?
**A:** Check:
1. Valid GitHub Copilot subscription
2. Internet connectivity
3. Signed in to GitHub in VS Code
4. GitHub token configured: `statik-cli config`

### Q: Does Copilot work on mobile?
**A:** Yes! Copilot Chat works in the mobile web interface.

## üåê Mesh VPN & Networking

### Q: What is the mesh VPN for?
**A:** It allows secure global access to your development environment without port forwarding or complex networking setup.

### Q: How do I connect other devices?
**A:** 
1. Generate a key: `statik-cli mesh key`
2. Install Tailscale on the target device
3. Connect using the generated key

### Q: Is the mesh VPN secure?
**A:** Yes, it uses WireGuard encryption and operates independently of external services.

### Q: Can I use my existing Tailscale account?
**A:** Statik-Server uses Tailscale for mesh networking. You can use your existing Tailscale account or let the system manage the connection automatically.

## üì± Mobile Access

### Q: Can I code on my phone?
**A:** Yes! The web VS Code interface is optimized for mobile devices and includes GitHub Copilot support.

### Q: How do I access Statik-Server from mobile?
**A:** Scan the QR code displayed on startup or connect via the mesh VPN.

### Q: Does mobile VS Code have all features?
**A:** Most features work on mobile, including file editing, terminal access, and Copilot Chat. Some desktop-specific features may be limited.

### Q: Can I use an external keyboard with mobile?
**A:** Yes! Bluetooth keyboards work great for extended mobile coding sessions.

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Q: Is my code secure?
**A:** Your code stays on your server. Only GitHub Copilot features send code snippets to GitHub for AI processing (per their privacy policy).

### Q: Why do I see certificate warnings?
**A:** Statik-Server uses self-signed certificates. These are secure but cause browser warnings. You can add the certificate to your trust store to eliminate warnings.

### Q: Can others access my development environment?
**A:** Only devices you explicitly connect to your mesh VPN can access your environment. Local network access depends on your firewall settings.

### Q: How do I secure my installation?
**A:** See the [Security Guide](./user/SECURITY.md) for comprehensive security practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Q: Statik-Server won't start
**A:** 
1. Check status: `statik-cli status`
2. View logs: `statik-cli logs`
3. Try restarting: `statik-cli restart`
4. Check port conflicts: `netstat -tlnp | grep :8080`

### Q: Can't access from browser
**A:** 
1. Verify server is running: `statik-cli status`
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try direct IP: `http://[your-ip]:8080`
4. For HTTPS: Accept security certificate

### Q: Mesh VPN not working
**A:** 
1. Check mesh status: `statik-cli mesh status`
2. Regenerate keys: `statik-cli mesh key`
3. Restart server: `statik-cli restart`
4. Verify device can reach server IP

### Q: Performance is slow
**A:** 
1. Check system resources: `statik-cli status`
2. Close unnecessary applications
3. Use local VS Code for better performance
4. Check network connectivity
