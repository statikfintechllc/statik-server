      ## Resources


      For full details of this model, [release blog post](https://aka.ms/cohere-blog).


      ## Model Architecture


      This is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. After pretraining, this model uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference training to align model behavior to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.


      ### Tool use capabilities


      Command R has been specifically trained with conversational tool use capabilities. These have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template will likely reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.


      Command R's tool use functionality takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-system preamble), along with a list of available tools. The model will then generate a json-formatted list of actions to execute on a subset of those tools. Command R may use one of its supplied tools more than once.


      The model has been trained to recognise a special directly_answer tool, which it uses to indicate that it doesn't want to use any of its other tools. The ability to abstain from calling a specific tool can be useful in a range of situations, such as greeting a user, or asking clarifying questions. We recommend including the directly_answer tool, but it can be removed or renamed if required.


      ### Grounded Generation and RAG Capabilities


      Command R has been specifically trained with grounded generation capabilities. This means that it can generate responses based on a list of supplied document snippets, and it will include grounding spans (citations) in its response indicating the source of the information. This can be used to enable behaviors such as grounded summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).This behavior has been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template may reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.


      Command R's grounded generation behavior takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-supplied system preamble, indicating task, context and desired output style), along with a list of retrieved document snippets. The document snippets should be chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk. Document snippets consist of key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings, the values can be text or semi-structured.


      By default, Command R will generate grounded responses by first predicting which documents are relevant, then predicting which ones it will cite, then generating an answer. Finally, it will then insert grounding spans into the answer. See below for an example. This is referred to as accurate grounded generation.


      The model is trained with a number of other answering modes, which can be selected by prompt changes . A fast citation mode is supported in the tokenizer, which will directly generate an answer with grounding spans in it, without first writing the answer out in full. This sacrifices some grounding accuracy in favor of generating fewer tokens.


      ### Code Capabilities


      Command R has been optimized to interact with your code, by requesting code snippets, code explanations, or code rewrites. It might not perform well out-of-the-box for pure code completion. For better performance, we also recommend using a low temperature (and even greedy decoding) for code-generation related instructions.

      ## Resources


      For full details of this model, [release blog post](https://aka.ms/cohere-blog).


      ## Model Architecture


      This is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. After pretraining, this model uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference training to align model behavior to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.


      ### Tool use capabilities


      Command R+ has been specifically trained with conversational tool use capabilities. These have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template will likely reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.


      Command R+'s tool use functionality takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-system preamble), along with a list of available tools. The model will then generate a json-formatted list of actions to execute on a subset of those tools. Command R+ may use one of its supplied tools more than once.


      The model has been trained to recognise a special directly_answer tool, which it uses to indicate that it doesn't want to use any of its other tools. The ability to abstain from calling a specific tool can be useful in a range of situations, such as greeting a user, or asking clarifying questions. We recommend including the directly_answer tool, but it can be removed or renamed if required.


      ### Grounded Generation and RAG Capabilities


      Command R+ has been specifically trained with grounded generation capabilities. This means that it can generate responses based on a list of supplied document snippets, and it will include grounding spans (citations) in its response indicating the source of the information. This can be used to enable behaviors such as grounded summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).This behavior has been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template may reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.


      Command R+'s grounded generation behavior takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-supplied system preamble, indicating task, context and desired output style), along with a list of retrieved document snippets. The document snippets should be chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk. Document snippets consist of key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings, the values can be text or semi-structured.


      By default, Command R+ will generate grounded responses by first predicting which documents are relevant, then predicting which ones it will cite, then generating an answer. Finally, it will then insert grounding spans into the answer. See below for an example. This is referred to as accurate grounded generation.


      The model is trained with a number of other answering modes, which can be selected by prompt changes .

This sacrifices some grounding accuracy in favor of generating fewer tokens.

      GPT-4o mini enables a broad range of tasks with its low cost and latency,
      such as applications that chain or parallelize multiple model calls (e.g.,
      calling multiple APIs), pass a large volume of context to the model (e.g.,
      full code base or conversation history), or interact with customers
      through fast, real-time text responses (e.g., customer support chatbots).


      Today, GPT-4o mini supports text and vision in the API, with support for text, image, video and audio inputs and outputs coming in the future. The model has a context window of 128K tokens and knowledge up to October 2023. Thanks to the improved tokenizer shared with GPT-4o, handling non-English text is now even more cost effective.


      GPT-4o mini surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other small models on academic benchmarks across both textual intelligence and multimodal reasoning, and supports the same range of languages as GPT-4o. It also demonstrates strong performance in function calling, which can enable developers to build applications that fetch data or take actions with external systems, and improved long-context performance compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo.

      #### OpenAI's o1 Series Models: Enhanced Reasoning and Problem Solving on
      Azure


      The OpenAI o1 series models are specifically designed to tackle reasoning and problem-solving tasks with increased focus and capability. These models spend more time processing and understanding the user's request, making them exceptionally strong in areas like science, coding, math and similar fields. For example, o1 can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data, by physicists to generate complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics, and by developers in all fields to build and execute multi-step workflows.


      o1-mini is developed to provide a faster, cheaper reasoning model that is particularly effective at coding. As a smaller model, o1-mini is 80% cheaper than o1-preview, making it a powerful, cost-effective model for applications that require reasoning but not broad world knowledge.


      _IMPORTANT: o1-mini model is available for limited access. To try the model in the playground, registration is required, and access will be granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria._


      ## Key Capabilities of the o1 Series


      - Complex Code Generation: Capable of generating algorithms and handling advanced coding tasks to support developers.

      - Advanced Problem Solving: Ideal for comprehensive brainstorming sessions and addressing multifaceted challenges.

      - Complex Document Comparison: Perfect for analyzing contracts, case files, or legal documents to identify subtle differences.

      - Instruction Following and Workflow Management: Particularly effective for managing workflows requiring shorter contexts.


      ## Model Variants


      - o1-preview: The most capable model in the o1 series, offering enhanced reasoning abilities.

      - o1-mini: A faster and more cost-efficient option in the o1 series, ideal for coding tasks requiring speed and lower resource consumption.


      ## Limitations


      o1-mini model is currently in preview and do not include some features available in other models, such as image understanding and structured outputs found in the GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models. For many tasks, the generally available GPT-4o models may still be more suitable.

      ## Model Architecture


      Phi-3-Medium-128k-Instruct has 14B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model. The model is fine-tuned with Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to ensure alignment with human preferences and safety guidelines.


      ## Training Datasets


      Our training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 4.8 trillion tokens (including 10% multilingual), and is a combination of 

      1) Publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code; 

      2) Newly created synthetic, "textbook - like" data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.); 

      3) High quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.


      We are focusing on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and we filter the publicly available documents to contain the correct level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the small size models.

      state-of-the-art open model trained with the Phi-3 datasets that includes
      both synthetic data and the filtered publicly available websites data with
      a focus on high-quality and reasoning dense properties. The model supports
      128K context length (in tokens).


      The model underwent a post-training process that incorporates both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization for the instruction following and safety measures.

      When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3-Small-128K-Instruct showcased a robust and state-of-the-art performance among models of the same-size and next-size-up.

      ## Model Architecture


      Phi-3 Small-128K-Instruct has 7B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model. The model is fine-tuned with Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to ensure alignment with human preferences and safety guidelines.


      ## Training Datasets


      Our training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 4.8 trillion tokens (including 10% multilingual), and is a combination of 

      1) Publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code; 

      2) Newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.); 

      3) High quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.


      We are focusing on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and we filter the publicly available documents to contain the correct level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the small size models. More details about data can be found in the [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://aka.ms/phi3-tech-report).
