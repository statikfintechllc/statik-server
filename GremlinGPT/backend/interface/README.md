# Backend Interface Module

The `backend/interface` module provides command-line and programmatic interfaces for interacting with GremlinGPT's core functionality. This module serves as a bridge between external commands and internal system operations.

## Components

### 🖥️ commands.py
**Command Processing & Execution Interface**
- Command-line interface (CLI) command parsing and execution
- Programmatic command interface for other modules
- Memory embedding and vector operations
- File system operations and data management
- FAISS vector database operations and indexing
- JSON data processing and validation
- System state queries and modifications
- Integration with memory and knowledge systems

## Architecture

The interface module provides a clean abstraction layer between external commands and internal system operations:

                         │               │
                ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
                │    Memory       │    │   File System  │

                └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## Command Categories

### Memory Operations

## Command Interface

The commands module provides both programmatic and CLI interfaces:

### Programmatic Interface
```python
from backend.interface.commands import CommandProcessor

processor = CommandProcessor()
result = processor.execute_command("embed", {"text": "sample text"})
```

### CLI Interface
```bash
python -m backend.interface.commands embed --text "sample text"
python -m backend.interface.commands query --vector [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
python -m backend.interface.commands status --component memory
```
