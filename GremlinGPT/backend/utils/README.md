# Backend Utils Module

The `backend/utils` module contains utility functions and helper modules that support backend operations across the GremlinGPT system. These utilities provide common functionality for git operations, file management, and system administration tasks.

## Components

### 🔧 git_ops.py
**Git Automation & Repository Management**
- Automated git operations for system files and logs
- Commit automation with timestamped messages
- File archiving and version control integration
- JSON log file management and rotation
- Repository state management and synchronization
- Branch operations and merge conflict handling
- Automated backup and restore functionality
- Integration with system-wide file tracking

## Architecture

The utils module provides shared functionality across backend components:
